They weren't broken so idk why they were changed, it doesn't look great and is very confusing, just keep it the way it was!! It was fine! Nothing. Was wrong, and if there was a bug, just fix that, not how it looks.\",\n",

I create the whole video, get the title ready, hashtags, etc only to find out the audio has cut out 1/3 of the way through the video. This is getting beyond frustrating. I'm not the only person this is happening to though as I've been in contact with other creators who have said the same happens to them.\",\n",
